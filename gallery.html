            <p class="infomargin">Cocobeet is loved for its extensive range
                of cold-pressed juices and smoothies.
                It has also built up a following for its
                Pure Foods menu of organic, vegan,
                grab-and-go meals. There are options
                for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack

            <p class="infomargin">This NYC-based, 100% vegan chain has an
                extensive menu of comfort faves—burgers,
                soups, creative salads, mac n’ cheese,
                subs, clam chowder, and lobster rolls.
                Vegans can indulge in weekend brunch
                with tofu scrambles, sausage, hash browns,
                and pancakes. Of course there’s dessert
                too - cupcakes, cookies, ice cream, shakes,
                and more.</p>

                appetizers and mains, it’s all vegan.
                There’s a lot of tofu on the menu, but
                the faux “shrimp,” “chicken,” “beef,” and
                “duck” dishes are flavorful enough rival
                the real thing.</p>
