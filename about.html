            <p>Hi there! My name is Christina, I'm a design student based in Boston, Massachusetts. Originally from Pelham, New Hampshire, I've always wanted to come to the city and showcase my designs to the rest of the world. After graduating high school, I ended up at Suffolk University, and the have been studying graphic design for the past three years.<br><br>
                To me, moving to a new city meant one thing and one thig only - finding new places to eat! As an avid foodie and vegan connoisseur, it was my goal to find as many places that served healthy, delicious, and completely vegan meals. It wasn't easy, but thanks to the growing popularity of vegan food, more or more places started to show up. In this carefully curated (and yummy looking) list, I hope you find your answer to the next best vegan restaurant there is. Stay hungry, Beantown!</p>
